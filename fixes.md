# Fixes

## Board redesign

* Reverse resonance pot RV18
* Remove integrator feedback resistors R52 and R57
* R44 to pin 9 of U9
* R54 to pin 14 of U10
* R50 to pin 3 of U10

## Bugs

* VCA seems to have less than unity gain?
* Filter clips when oscillating
* Stability control has small range
* Noise is too quiet


## Investigate

* Better resonance control range

## Fixed but needs noting in changes

changes to variable divider
