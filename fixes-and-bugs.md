# Fixes and Bugs

Fixes and caveats for any versions of the PCB that need them.

## Revision 2

Pin 19 on IC U14 is incorrectly connected to ground.
Using a sharp blade, cut the ground traces around the pin and then solder a jumper between pins 19 and 20.

The in-circuit programmer header for the ATTiny is connected to the incorrect pins so isn't usable.
